# Image Alt Tag Reviewer

This WordPress plugin checks your media for alt tags and shows any issues or missing tags. It's pretty basic in terms of plugins, just adds some actions to the columns of the media library and a little smidge of jQuery to change the color of a single media item if its lacks an alt tag. 

## Deployment

Download the ZIP file and install like a regular plugin. You can also connect via SFTP/FTP to your server and upload it that way.
